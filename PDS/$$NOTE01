Dear Sam,

I found some issues in the Archiver.

There were 2 real errors and 1 minor issue in the Archiver.

These are the issues.

Version 6.1.5: September 2023

- Fix an ABEND0C4 in module ARCHRSPC by adding
    MF=(G,GENWRK) in the TESTCB te restore the
    reentrancy of the loadmodule.

- Fix incorrout completion message after ALTER.

- Fix detection of duplicate key in ARCHRSPC, to
    avoid deletion of item if the newname exist in
    ALTER (rename item).

These notes are in @FILE147.

Would you like to post the attached file onto CBT?
(of course...!!!)

Thank you in advance for your efforts.

All the best of everything to you and your family.

Met vriendelijke groet/With kind regards/Mit freundlichen
